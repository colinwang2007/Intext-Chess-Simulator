# Intext-Chess-Simulator

This is a simulated version of chess that is played through commands typed in the system monitor. The board is created using different symbols, and the two teams consist of capital letters versus lowercase letters. It is a two player game, with alternating turns taken.

In early 2023, I wanted to create an in text board game that was neither too simple nor complex where I could play and let others as well. At that time, chess was popular, and many of my classmates (including myself) played on chess.com excessively. Thus, I decided to create chess using java. However, the different mechanics of the board game made it tedious to code, and in the end, it is still pretty difficult to play.

To move, type the algebraic notation of the square (in lowercase) where the desired piece is currently situated followed by the square of the piece's desired destination, separated by a space.
